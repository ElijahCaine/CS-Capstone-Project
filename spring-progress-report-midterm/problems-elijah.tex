Our group has had many problems.
During this term most problems fell into one of two buckets:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Technical stumblings.
  \item Unfair work distribution.
\end{itemize}

The first are obvious.
They were problems encountered in development like an edge case or a bug or something \textit{`just not working'}.
These were solved swiftly and we were able to squash all of the bugs well before our code-complete deadline.

The second has been a problem in our group the entire year.
These were things like Zixun not being technically able to perform a task and offloading one of his responsibities onto another team-member.
For example I ended up being responsbile for generating benchmarking data for our application \textbf{and} creating the entire website.
He was also responsible for some component of the C/C++ code, but was not able to write any C/C++ code so this responsibility was offloaded to Shuai.

Of course these responsibilities could have been `dropped', but for the sake of the project I decided that it was in our best interetst to ensure that the aplication \textit{worked} instead of selfishly allowing major, show-stopping components of the project to go undone.
