For this term, there are three things to do by end of the term.
EXPO, three short writings and final report are remaining tasks.
The most important thing is attending and presenting in EXPO. 
I think we should make two plans for the EXPO.
One is what should we do during the EXPO, the other is if I have problems in the EXPO, what should I do?
When we are preparing for the EXPO, we must to know all of knowledge of application and how to present to audience.
The audience may not understand what we are talking and explaining for this application and we have to use simple words and simple logic method to make them to understand easily.
We should practice more and introduce application to our friends and ask them the feedback.
During the EXPO, if I can't answer or explain clearly, I will look for helps from our team members.
