Here is what I should do in the future.
\begin{itemize}
  \item we need polish our document to make it easy to read and understand.
  \item I need go throught what we have, and perpare for the EXPO day presentation.
  \item I may need do more test to make sure that it is not broken during we EXPO demo.
\end{itemize}
