I have no remaining development tasks.
The only things left we have are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item This report.
  \item The demo accompanying this report.
  \item Engineering expo.
  \item Our final project report.
\end{itemize}

This is all completely managable and I believe we will complete all of it on time and with relatively few hiccups along the way.
I am not concerned about our performance at Expo, or at least not concerned about my own performance at expo.
I have practiced our pitch many times and am able to get a live demo of our product quickly and dependably.

As a group, we did not hit all of our project requirements, most of which were the job of Zixun Lu; the largest of these beign a software installation package.
