I learned JQuery for this project!
JQuery is a very small Javascript framework focused on manipulating the HTML dom and doing tasks that are \textit{very} common in Javascript, like AJAX requests.

Here's some of the code I wrote for the frontned interface.:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
    // When happens when you submit the form
    $("form#transform").submit(function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();

        var file = "";
        var formData = new FormData($(this)[0]);
        formData.append("parameters", JSON.stringify(processParameters()));

        // Send the modified form to the /cgi-bin/xzes.py endpoint.
        // If you messed with the apache service this will need to change.
        $.ajax({
            url: "/cgi-bin/xzes.py",
            type: "POST",
            data: formData,
            dataType: "text",
            async: true,
            statusCode: {
                404: function(data) {
                    notSuccessful("&#x1F6AB; &#x2601; Could not reach the transformer server...");
                },
                400: function(data) {
                    notSuccessful(data.responseText);
                },
                // On successful transformation
                200: function(data) {
                    // If the repsonse is non-empty
                    if (data.responseText != ""
                     && data.responseText != undefined) {
                        // Print the success, the filename, and give buttons to view/downlaod the file.
                        successful(data.responseText);
                    } else if (typeof(data) == "string") {
                        // The response may just be a string...
                        // We're not sure why this happens sometimes...
                        successful(data);
                    } else {
                        // Otherwise give a generic failure message
                        // Weird edge case where output xml is parsed by jquery as html
                        notSuccessful("The transformation was not successful.");
                    }
                },
            },
            cache: false,
            contentType: false,
            processData: false,
        });
   });
\end{lstlisting}

This describes what happens when you click the "transform" button.
In broad terms, it constructs an HTTP POST request form, sends that form, and reacts based on the response.
When it gets either a positive or negative status code from the server it will either display an error to the user or give the user buttons to download and display the transformation results.

This results in the frontend dynamically loading the result of a document transformation in the background.
The user is not redirected to a new webpage when they submit a document transformation, instead they click the button, the transformation is carried out in the background, and they are shown the new files when the transformation is complete.
