At this point in development we are (mostly) feature complete.
This was not without a bit of drama and stress, it was a bumpy road.

We have completed our requirements for the project, and even completed an additional requirement on top of that.
These requirements include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Basic XML + Stylesheet document transformation.
  \item Document caching.
  \item Parallel document transformation.
  \item Web interface for document processing.
\end{itemize}

The additional requirement was one we found while talking with our sponsor.
We found that our application did not meet the requirements necessary to perform \textit{real world} document transformations, due primarily to our inability to handle extra resource files and custom build parameters.
We added the build parameters (custom variables for the current transformation), but did not add the extra resource files.
