## Building LaTeX Docs

At the root of the repository run `make`.  This will build the PDF documents.

If this process fails for any reason please ensure you have the right dependencies installed.  This assumes you are working on an OSU Linux Engineering working state (access.engr.oregonstat.edu for instance).

## Repository Structure

At the top level of the repository lives all of the main assignments.

In the `sections` directory live the sub-sections of the document.  These include things like the *Abstract*, *Problem Statement*, *References*, etc.

In the `extras` directory there are the LaTeX specific files that do not contribute to the content of the project.

## Contributing Docs

When making any changes please follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch.
2. Make your changes on the new branch.
3. Push your branch with the changes.
4. Tell the team about your changes.
5. Once everybody is happy with the changes they can be merged.
