This archive differs from the upstream git repository [1] in the following ways:

- The Makefile's clean directive does not depend on `git`.

NOTE: The pdf included was not generated with this Makefile.
This makefile will get you by, but will not create well-formatted slides.
The PDF here was generated on Overleaf.
We're still not sure why we're not able to generate good pdfs...

Archive created using the command at the base of the repository:
