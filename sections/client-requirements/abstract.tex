This document outlines the client requirements for the OSU CS Capstone project ``High Performance XML/XSLT Transformation Server''.
This covers what will be required of the application to perform well, the interfaces the application will have, optimizations the application will have, and restrictions on the application.
% This document outlines the problem, and proposed solution, for creating a high-throughput and multi-platform XML/XSLT
% translation server.
% While XML/XSLT document transformation is not new, existing systems do not meet industry needs for
% high-volume document transformation; blindly spending resources fully compiling documents at each request, even if they
% were previously processed.
% Our proposed solution is to cache parsed documents in memory, in the XML/XSLT transformer and
% XML parser, to avoid spending computing resources re-compiling documents which have already been processed.
% The project
% will be developed with the Apache Xerces-C, Xalan-C, and ICU libraries for XSLT transformation, XML parsing, and Unicode
% support respectively.
% As a stretch-goal this project will be design to target multiple operating systems, and create installation
% packages for each supported platforms.
