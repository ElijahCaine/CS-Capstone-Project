\section{Supporting Information}

\subsection{Table of contents and index}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The table of contents and index are quite important and should follow general compositional practices.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Appendixes}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The appendixes are not always considered part of the actual SRS and are not always necessary.
% They may include
% 
% 1. Sample input/output formats, descriptions of cost analysis studies, or results of user surveys;
% 
% 2. Supporting or background information that can help the readers of the SRS;
% 
% 3. A description of the problems to be solved by the software;
% 
% 4. Special packaging instructions for the code and the media to meet security, export, initial loading, or other requirements.
% 
% When appendixes are included, the SRS should explicitly state whether or not the appendixes are to be considered part of the requirements.
