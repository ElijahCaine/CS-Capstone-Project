\section{Overall description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements.
% This section does not state specific requirements.
% Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3 of the SRS, and makes them easier to understand.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following sections of this document outline the factors that affect the creation of XZES40-Transformer at a high-level.

\subsection{Product perspective}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This subsection of the SRS should put the product into perspective with other related products.
% If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here.
% If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, as frequently occurs,
% then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should identify interfaces between that system and the software.
% A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
% This subsection should also describe how the software operates inside various constraints.
% For example, these constraints could include
% 1. System interfaces;
% 2. User interfaces;
% 3. Hardware interfaces;
% 4. Software interfaces;
% 5. Communications interfaces;
% 6. Memory;
% 7. Operations;
% 8. Site adaptation requirements.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{System interfaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should list each system interface and identify the functionality of the software to accomplish the system requirement and the interface description to match the system.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XZES40-Transformer application will interface with the outside world through an Apache CGI script.
This script will wrap our application by passing \inlinecode{POST} requests to the application URL endpoint through to our application.
Our program will complete the request and pass the transformed document back to the user via the CGI script.

The XZES40-Transformer CGI wrapper script will receive a transformation request in the form of a \inlinecode{HTTP POST} request from a user and respond with the transformed file and an \textbf{OK} status.
If an error occurs it will respond with a \textbf{SERVER ERROR} response and no file.

% \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Data base
%   \item User and manager
%   \item XML servers
% \end{enumerate}
%
% Our server has 3 layer of actor, first layer is user part, such as reader and manager.
% Second layer is XML servers, which contain XML parse and other XML transformation part.
% Third layer is our database where we store our data.
% User can connect to webpage and send request to XML servers,and then XML servers will search from database and query data out, after that XML server can compile to Unicode type file and give back to user.

\subsubsection{User interfaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should specify 
% 1. The logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and its users.
%    This includes those configuration characteristics (e.g., required screen formats, page or window layouts, 
%    content of any reports or menus, or availability of programmable function keys) necessary to accomplish the software requirements.
% 2. All the aspects of optimizing the interface with the person who must use the system.
%    This may simply comprise a list of do's and don'ts on how the system will appear to the user.
%    One example may be a requirement for the option of long or short error messages.
%    Like all others, these requirements should be verifiable, e.g., “a clerk typist grade 4 can do function X in Z min after 1 h of training” rather than “a typist can do function X.” (This may also be specified in the Software System Attributes under a section titled Ease of Use.)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XZES40 will have two user interfaces which will access it's functionality over the internet.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Website to access XZES40-Transformer via a web-browser.
    \item A CLI to access XZES40-Transformer via a terminal interface.
\end{itemize}
% Our application requires at least 800x600 resolution and 256 color monitor, and standard keyboard, and mouse is option.
% Managers can control database in their experience after see the GUI of transfer management application.
% User just need click webpage request, and other things is working behind the webpage.

\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system.
% This includes configuration characteristics (number of ports, instruction sets, etc.).
% It also covers such matters as what devices are to be supported, how they are to be supported, and protocols.
% For example, terminal support may specify full-screen support as opposed to line-by-line support.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XZES-Transformer will be targeted to run on an x86-64 CPU architecture server.
Any computer with a browser will be able to access the web-interface.

XZES40-Transformer will not have any direct physical interfaces as it is meant to be interacted with over \inlinecode{HTTP/HTTPS}.

% We will support windows, Unix based operation  system, iOS and android.
% We will create API for our application, so we can easy to move application to any platform.
% GUI is required rather than line by line terminal control.

\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should specify the use of other required software products (e.g., a data management system, an operating system, or a mathematical package),
% and interfaces with other application systems (e.g., the linkage between an accounts receivable system and a general ledger system).
% For each required software product, the following should be provided:
% - Name;
% - Mnemonic;
% - Specification number;
% - Version number;
% - Source.
% For each interface, the following should be provided:
% - Discussion of the purpose of the interfacing software as related to this software product.
% - Definition of the interface in terms of message content and format.
%   It is not necessary to detail any well-documented interface, but a reference to the document defining the interface is required.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Below is a list of software required for the XZES-40 (on the host and on remote systems).

\end{description}


% SQL database is required for our application.
% Version of SQL is newer than SQL2003
% UNIX or Linux based on operation system is required, such as mac OS, debin, center OS.
% All of operation system should be newest version.

%GUI support package??

\subsubsection{Communications interfaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should specify the various interfaces to communications such as local network protocols, etc.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

An internet connection between the host and client is required.
The host and client will be communicating over HTTP or HTTPs.

% The data is exchanged between the catalog system and the Enterprise Buyer system via a web browser (HTTP or HTTPS).
% After the data has been sent in XML format to the Enterprise Buyer application server, depending on the OCL version, 
% an ABAP-XSL transformation is carried out or the SAP Business Connector is used up map the XML file in an internal representation.
% The following graphic illustrates the data exchange between the external catalog system and Enterprise Buyer.

\subsubsection{Memory constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should specify any applicable characteristics and limits on primary and secondary memory.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Since our application will be using memory to cache objects an appropriate amount of memory should be dedicated to our application, depending on how much it is going to be used.
A minimum of 4Gb should be dedicated to the machine using this application, but the more the better.

\subsubsection{Operations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should specify the normal and special operations required by the user such as
% 1. The various modes of operations in the user organization (e.g., user-initiated operations);
% 2. Periods of interactive operations and periods of unattended operations;
% 3. Data processing support functions;
% 4. Backup and recovery operations.
% This is sometimes specified as part of the User Interfaces section.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection{Site adaptation requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This should
% 3. Define the requirements for any data or initialization sequences that are specific to a given site, mission, 
% or operational mode (e.g., grid values, safety limits, etc.);
% 2. Specify the site or mission-related features that should be modified to adapt the software to a particular installation.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our application will target the Debian Linux operating system.
When installing our application a system administrator will acquire a Debian installation file (\inlinecode{xzes40-transformer.deb}), run the installation file, and begin the installed service.

The steps will look as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
Download xzes40-transformer.deb
$ wget http://example.com/xzes40-transformer.deb

Install the package
$ dpkg -i xzes40-transformer.deb

Enable the xzes40-transformer Systemd service
$ systemctl enable xzes40-transformer

Start the Systemd service
$ systemctl start xzes40-transformer
\end{lstlisting}

Installation on a new Debian system should require the same procedure as listed above.

Installation on a non-Debian operating system will require a system-specific installation file.
Creating installation files for Windows, Mac, and other Linux distributions is one of our stretch goals. 

% XML is the most important and commonly used form of the most commonly used data exchange representation on the grid today.
% XML is a subset of SGML that describes various types of data in a structured way.
% It allows document creators to create new tags to better describe the data.
% XML can describe almost all areas of data.
% It uses strict nested tokens to represent data, and is particularly well suited for multi-site data exchange environments on the Internet.
% XML itself is extensible and only defines standard syntax.
% XML is a language for creating industry vocabularies and applications whose basic syntax for the file is defined by the XML schema defined by the W3C Create File.
% In the grid environment, because of the XML file structure and readability, XML data often as documents or process data to the form of cooperation in circulation, it also needs to use encryption and signature to ensure that XML-based data exchange activities in the information safety.
% The security of XML language is the foundation of information exchange on grid.
% To protect the security of XML data exchange, the International Organization for Standardization W3C proposed a series of XML security services, the new standard for XML as a data exchange carrier to provide security applications.
% These standards include: XML Encryption, XML Sigllature, XML Key Management Specification (XKMS), XML Access % Control Markup Language (XACML), etc.

\subsection{Product functions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This subsection of the SRS should provide a summary of the major functions that the software will perform.
% For example, an SRS for an accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement,
% and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
% Sometimes the function summary that is necessary for this part can be taken directly from the section of 
% the higher-level specification (if one exists) that allocates particular functions to the software product.
% Note that for the sake of clarity
% 1. The functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the customer
%    or to anyone else reading the document for the first time.
% 
% 2. Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships.
%    Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships among variables.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XZES40-Transformer will perform one function: XML/XSLT document transformation.
Given an XML and XSLT documents it will return a transformed XML document.

This functionality will be accessible via a web interface.

% Our XML server are common XML documents transfer servers.
% The big different between normal XML server and our XML server is that we create cache for our server, so this prevent xml server compile each time which is waste system source.
% So, user can easily click webpage request and receive file that they want.
% Our server just quickly grab data from database, compile files, and send back to user.
% we also create server management application for manager, and it is graphic interface application, so people easy to use.

\subsection{User characteristics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This subsection of the SRS should describe those general characteristics of the intended 
% users of the product including educational level, experience, and technical expertise.
% It should not be used to state specific requirements, but rather should provide the reasons 
% why certain specific requirements are later specified in Section 3 of the SRS.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \textbf{user} of our application is expected to have common web-interface knowledge (e.g., they should know how to navigate a website, upload a file, and download a file).

\textbf{COMPLETE THIS SECTION}

% User should understand the basically computer knowledge.
% They better be above high school educational level, 
% and they should have experience with windows application interface.
% Manager should understand C or C++ programming language, if manager want know how software working.

\subsection{Constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This subsection of the SRS should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developer's options.
% These include
% 
% 1. Regulatory policies;
% 2. Hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);
% 3. Interfaces to other applications;
% 4. Parallel operation;
% 5. Audit functions;
% 6. Control functions;
% 7. Higher-order language requirements;
% 8. Signal handshake protocols (e.g., XON-XOFF, ACK-NACK);
% 9. Reliability requirements;
% 10. Criticality of the application;
% 11 Safety and security considerations.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XZES40-Transformer will be subject to the following limitations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It must be licensed under Apache 2.0.
  \item It must handle memory limitations gracefully.
  \item It must restart if a fatal error occurs.
  \item It must run on Debian 8.
\end{itemize}

% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item our application is open source, but copying code is forbid.
%   \item application should be running at larger severs.
%   \item C++ and C programming language is the first order language.
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS.
% These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS.
% For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product.
% If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XZES40-Transformer will be written to interface with an OS agnostic API for any operating-system level operations (e.g., reading and writing from the cache).
As a result our application will be portable to new operating systems eventually, but to begin with it will only run on Debian.
If a user attempts to install the Debian package on a non-Debian system the installation will fail.
Installation of our application from source may work on non-Debian systems, but is not guaranteed.

XZES40-Transformer will assume that the relevant libraries and languages listed under Software Interfaces are already installed.
The installation package will resolve these dependencies if they are not already installed.

% Our application is working with a debin system on Intel servers.
% If debin is not installed, we can take other Linux operation system.
% If SQL database is not working, we also can take MySQL or SQL MS Access.
% If GUI of our application is broken, user can be using command line to access our application.

\subsection{Apportioning of requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This subsection of the SRS should identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

XZES40-Transformer will guarantee the following items completed:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Working transformation application.
  \item Apache CGI web-interface for the application.
  \item A Debian installation package.
\end{itemize}

Given enough time we will add the following features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Windows installation package.
  \item Mac installation package.
  \item FreeBSD installation package.
  \item CentOS installation package.
  \item A command-line interface.
\end{itemize}
