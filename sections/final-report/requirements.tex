This section outlines requirements which changed during development.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c | c }
    \# & Requirements & What happened & Comments \\
    \hline \\
    1 & Daemon & This requirement was more complex than initially expected, there was confusion about the complexity of this component. We were originally unclear about weather we needed to run a daemon for our in-memory cache, or if we could store the cache in a separate application like Redis. & \\
    2 & CLI Interface & A CLI Interface was not explicitly created for the application, however one was created for testing purposes. & With small changes this interface may be created if further development takes place \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Removed requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What existing requirements were deleted?

% | 3 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section outlines requirements which were removed during development.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | c | c }
    \# & Requirements & What happened & Comments \\
    \hline \\
    1 & Installation Package &
      This requirement was not explicitly removed from the requirements list, however no effort was made to complete this component of the project. & 
      Neither the core requirements, a Debian package, nor the stretch goals, a Windows, CentOS, and BSD package, were pursued.
      The client agreed that as a prototype an installation package was not required to call the project as success. \\
