\section{Project requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Introduction.
% What the project requirements are.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Before development can take place the team responsible for a project collects the necessary requirements for a project and criteria for success.
These are what the client ought to ``grade'' the final product against to judge ``Was this project a success?''

\subsection{Preliminary project requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Your original Requirements Document.

% > This needs to be the original document, showing what you thought, at the time, was the project definition.
% > This needs to include the original Gantt chart.

\subsection{Added requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What new requirements were added?
% Why?
% Use the following table format:
% | 1 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
% | 2 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
% | 3 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section outlines requirements added to the project during development.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | p{7cm} | p{6cm} }
    \hline 
    \# & Requirements & What happened & Comments \\ \hline
    1 & Parameter passing & This is a simple parameter passing requirement that is required by client in spring term. It just pass the parameter to our transformer, so transformer know what the output looks like & \\ \hline
    2 & Additional file passing & Some XML file and XSLT file require the DTD file which is a database file, so we add this function to our transformer, because we need benchmark our program.& \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Updated requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What existing requirements were changed?
% Why?
% Use the following table format:
% | 1 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
% | 2 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
% | 3 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section outlines requirements which changed during development.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | p{7cm} | p{6cm} }
    \hline
    \# & Requirements & What happened & Comments \\ \hline
    1 & Daemon & This requirement was more complex than initially expected, there was confusion about the complexity of this component. We were originally unclear about weather we needed to run a daemon for our in-memory cache, or if we could store the cache in a separate application like Redis. & \\ \hline
    2 & CLI Interface & A CLI Interface was not explicitly created for the application, however one was created for testing purposes. & With small changes this interface may be created if further development takes place \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Removed requirements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What existing requirements were deleted?
% Why?
% Use the following table format:
% | 1 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
% | 2 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
% | 3 | Requirement | What happened to it | Comments
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This section outlines requirements which were removed during development.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c | p{7cm} | p{6cm} }
    \hline
    \# & Requirements & What happened & Comments \\ \hline
    1 & Installation Package &
      This requirement was not explicitly removed from the requirements list, however no effort was made to complete this component of the project. & 
      Neither the core requirements, a Debian package, nor the stretch goals, a Windows, CentOS, and BSD package, were pursued.
      The client agreed that as a prototype an installation package was not required to call the project as success. \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
