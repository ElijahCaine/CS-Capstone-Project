\section{Parallel Document Transformation}

\subsection{Options}

\subsection{Goals for use in design}

XZES40-Transformer will be increased performance by using parrallel computation.
The parallel processing of the containment queries against an XML document utilizes parallel variants of the serial algorithm.
There are two ways to do the prallel computation.


\subsection{Criteria being evaluated}

XZES40-Transformer use the parallel computation method do the same processing and operating in parallel.
The criteria for a good tool in this area is mostly how easy to write code it is with the tool and how maintainable the code is, and of course how fast the eventual program is.

\subsection{Discussion}

Pthreads is a standard for prgramming with threads, it can achieve big speedups, as all cores of your CPU are used at the same time.
OpenMP uses a set of compiler directives that are incorporated at compile-time to generate a multi-threaded version of your code.
MPI allows us to manage allocation, communication, and synchronization of a set of process.

\subsection{Selection}

We will use MPI because it is a high-level standard, and so it will be easy to develop with.
