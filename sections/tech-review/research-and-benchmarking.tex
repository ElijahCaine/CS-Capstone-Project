\section{Research and Benchmarking}
The first application necessary for XML data processing are XML parsers and XML validators. The key aim is to check correctness of the input data, i.e. their conformance to either W3C recommendations or respective XML schemes. Hence, the benchmarks usually involve sets of correct and incorrect data and the goal is to test whether the application under test recognizes them correctly.
\subsection{XML Conformance Test Suites}
Binary tests contain a set of documents of one of the following categories: valid documents, invalid documents, non-well-formed documents, well-formed errors tied to external entity and documents with optional errors. Depending on the category, the tested parser must either accept or reject the document correctly (therefore, the tests are called binary). The expected behavior naturally differs if the tested parser is validating or non-validating. On the other hand, the output tests enable to test whether the respective applications report information as required by the recommendation. Again, validating processors are required to report more information than non-validating ones.
