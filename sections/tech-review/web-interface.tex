There is 3 different way to create a website pages. First is HTML, which is the core of the website language. Second is JavaScript, which is dynamic programming language used for creating website. Third is PHP, which is server language, but it make website too.

In my opinion, I prefer to take HTML as my solution technology for this project. The first reason is that HTML is easy website language for everyone, and it support other script language, such as CSS and JavaScript, so I can create better and user-friendly UI. PHP can create dynamic pages, but it works better on server, not for client. The second reason is that we don't need many dynamic information in our website interface. HTML can feedback a link to user via ajax, so user can download new xml file.
If clients want alternatives way to make website, I can take PHP as my solution technology, but the website will be looked like simple without designed.

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks. HTML elements are resented by tag. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML is a triad of cornerstone technology for website. There is no doubt that world wide web is created by HTML.

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server scripting language, and it also is a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive web Pages. PHP can be embedded into HTML code. PHP can be used in combination with various web template system, web content manamgement systems and web frameworks. Here is the PHP usage state,[cite here] and 224M sites use this language to make a website. The online cloud storage system[cite here] is PHP project that I find online. This project is designed for uploading and downloading file from the server. Becasue of PHP is server scripting language, it easy to transform data between clinet and server.

JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the web. However, HTML do display data, it shows static information. JavaScript can improve that function, so we will have dynamic information on the website. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multiparadigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. There is 103,717,163 live website using JavaScript in World Wide Web[cite]
