\section*{Problem Definition}

Extensible Markup Language/Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XML/XSLT) are common computational tasks requiring the compilation of XML/XSLT documents and the transformation of those into a desired output file.
Existing transformation systems accomplish this task by compiling the desired input files, running transformations on them, and producing an output document.
These systems unconditionally compile input documents, even if they have been processed before.
While this works for a small number of requests it does not scale well as it may spend resources processing documents which have already been used.
There is not a suitable XML/XSLT server which is able to detect a reoccurring document and bypass its compilation by pulling the compiled document (or transformation) from a cache.

% We want create new high volume translation server.
% Although XML document translation server is existed, it no longer meets the requirement of industry.
% Old system spends lots of resource on compiling document at each time, even if document have been processed last time.
% This behavior consumes tones of source and wastes time.
