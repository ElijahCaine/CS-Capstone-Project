This document outlines the problem, and proposed solution, for creating a high-throughput and multi-platform XML/XSLT translation server. 
While XML/XSLT document transformation is not new, existing systems do not meet industry needs for high-volume document transformation; blindly spending resources fully compiling documents at each request, even if they were previously processed.
Our proposed solution is to cache parsed documents in memory, in the XML/XSLT transformer and XML parser, to avoid spending computing resources re-compiling documents which have already been processed.
The project will be developed with the Apache Xerces-C, Xalan-C, and ICU libraries for XSLT transformation, XML parsing, and Unicode support respectively.
As a stretch-goal this project will be design to target multiple operating systems, and create installation packages for each supported platforms.
