\section*{Performance Metrics}

This application will need to have transformation correctness and a user interface.

The transformation correctness can be verified by taking known input documents with a predictable output document and verifying that they produce the correct results.
We will also verify that our caching layers do not find false-positives nor false-negatives.
These tests can be largely automated for convenience.

Our user interface can be anything from a native GUI, to a command-line interface, to a website.
For simplicity we will target a command-line interface.
That said we will be producing an HTTP web-api, so additional interfaces can be built by interacting with our application via common HTTP requests.
Time permitting we will target producing a simple web-interface since the users of this system will be individuals who are usually non-technical (e.g., local law enforcement, office managers, etc).

% As the requirement of client, they want the functioning and user interface correctly.
% This is all they want.
% We will make test that our server will transfer millions of files without any problem, and also we will have error check, so system will not die by one simple mistake.
% The user interface should be easy to use without any instruction.
