\section{Project Purpose}

\subsection{Zixun Lu}

\subsection{Shuai Peng}
The purpose of the XZES40-Transformer is to be high efficient output of XML/XSLT document transformation.
After User input XML file and one or more XSLT document, the XZES40-Transformer will perform document transformation, and return the result which is a new XML file.
For increasing performance, we want the XZES40-Transformer can be running as parallel computation.

\section{Project Status}
Because all of our teammate is busy in this term, we are slow than our schedule that we planed in the design document. 
So far, we just complete the basic function of the XZES40-Transformer. The XZES40-Transformer can get one XML file and XLS file and generate a new XML file.
The cache and the parallel computation will be completed during the beta version.

\subsection{Shuai Peng}
The remaining tasks that I am responsible for is complete the cache function, web interface, and Windows package.

\section{Problems Encountered}

\subsection{Zixun Lu}

\subsection{Shuai Peng}
When we are working on the basic document transformation, we face a strange problem.
The structure and the implementation of our code should be no any problem.
However the compile also say that we have expected unquality-id bugs for the xalanc++ transformer function.
Elijiah and me search on the Google, and most of answers said that you should check the syntax of code and some semicolon error.
We double check the code, but there is no error such that syntax and semicolon problem.
So, we come together and write a new prototype for test xalanc++ transformer, and the prototype is work correctly.
Thus, we decided to re-write the transformer.cpp, and make sure this code is only doing one things -- transformer document.
We change the structure of transformer.cpp from OOP to normal function code, and also make sure the document.cpp pair this file.
Finally, we get over this bugs, and our program can transformer document successful.
