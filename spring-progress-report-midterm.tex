\section{Project Purpose}

The purpose of the XZES40 document transformer is to accept input XML and XML stylesheet documents, perform an XML transformation with those files, and rerun the resulting transformation.

The application also adds the following useful features:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Provides a user with a web interface to request XML transformations via file upload.
  \item Caches processed documents, reducing overhead on subsiquent transformations.
  \item Performs document transformations in parallel to service multiple users and requests simultaneously.
\end{itemize}
